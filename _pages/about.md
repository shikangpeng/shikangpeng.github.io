Hello there! I am a second-year PhD student at the Rotman Research Institute at Baycrest, University of Toronto, working with [Dr. Brian Levine](https://levinelab.weebly.com/levine-lab-members.html) and collaborating frequently with [Dr. Bradley Buchsbaum](https://www.linguamemoria.com/). Previously, I obtained my Master's degree in Psychology from the University of Chicago, working with Drs. [Wilma Bainbridge](https://brainbridgelab.uchicago.edu/people/) and [Monica Rosenberg](https://cablab.uchicago.edu/). Prior to that, I completed my BSc (hons.) degree in Psychology from the University of Alberta, where I worked with [Dr. Peter Dixon](https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/pdixon) and [Dr. Peggt St Jacques](https://sites.psych.ualberta.ca/MElab/people/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of <b>naturalistic perception, memory, and imagery</b>, using <b>computational cognitive neuroscience</b> approaches with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study these processes and the individual differences that shape them.

Outside of my research, I sometimes build up lightweight tools to support experiment works - although, to be honest, playing video games tends to be the norm (as you can probably tell from my GitHub bio haha)
